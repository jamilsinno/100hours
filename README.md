## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, Node.js, Express, Passport.js, Tailwind CSS, Daisy UI, MongoDB

The project is a Full Stack application built using JavaScript and Node.js. Login is through Steam using the Passport.js Steam profile. Styling used for the front end is provided from Tailwind and Daisy UI. 

## Optimizations
 - Add a sort function for games based on user input
 - Add completion of achievements. Colored vs gray-scale to indicate completion of achievement.
 - Favorite to dos
 - Favorite games
 - Import friends list
 - Indicate private vs public status from Steam 

## Lessons Learned:

Began building the application using EJS. Styling with CSS became a time consuming and demanding process. Started exploring the use of Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI to ease the front-end design decision making.
