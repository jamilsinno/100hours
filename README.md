## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, Node, EJS & MongoDB

Application is created using CRUD operations, express and EJS. The inspiration behind this project was to track my unplayed stream library. The application currently has users input their list items and then manipulate the items based on completion, games currently being played and the want to replay.

## Optimizations
List of optimizations in no specific order:
 - Add styling to the application
 - Add user authentication
 - Add favourite games. - COMPLETE
 - Add Thumbs up and Thumbs down features.
 - Sort based on favorite or name. - IN PROGRESS

## Lessons Learned:

As the project continues to grow, I continue to learn about structuring my code and making things cohesive. Currently working on my pseudo code to make navigating the larger files easier. Applying MVC to work with industry standards.
